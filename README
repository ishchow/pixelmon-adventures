Accessories:
LCD Screen (Adafruit TFT with microSD card - ST7735R)
Kingston flash memory card - 4GB - microSDHC
Joystick (SparkFun COM-09032)
Arduino Mega 2560

Wiring Instructions (IMPORTANT - there are extra instructions for when there are two Arduinos):
Arduino 5V <--> Bread Board Positive Bus <--> Adafruit VCC
Arduino 5V <--> Bread Board Positive Bus <--> Joystick VCC
Arduino 5V <--> Bread Board Positive Bus <--> Adafruit LITE
Arduino GND <--> Bread Board Negative Bus <--> Adafruit GND
Arduino GND <--> Bread Board Negative Bus <--> Joystick GND
Arduino Analog Pin 0 <--> Joystick VERT
Arduino Analog Pin 1 <--> Joystick HORZ
Arduino Digital Pin 5 <--> Adafruit SD_CS
Arduino Digital Pin 6 <--> Adafruit TFT_CS
Arduino Digital Pin 7 <--> Adafruit D/C
Arduino Digital Pin 8 <--> Adafruit RESET
Arduino Digital Pin 9 <--> Joystick SEL
Arduino Digital Pin 50 <--> Adafruit MISO
Arduino Digital Pin 51 <--> Adafruit MOSI
Arduino Digital Pin 52 <--> Adafruit SCK

IMPORTANT - this part is for two Arduinos (named Arduino 1 and Arduino 2)
Arduino 1 Digital Pin 13 <--> Resistor(any) <--> Bread Board Positive Bus <--> 5V
Arduino 2 Digital Pin 13 <--> Resistor(any) <--> Bread Board Negative Bus <--> GND
Arduino 1 TX3 <--> Arduino 2 RX3
Arduino 1 RX3 <--> Arduino 2 TX3

How to run code:
IMPORTANT - two .lcd files are required on your SD card to run this code
sprite.lcd - 19x28
chess.lcd - 480x480
Connect the Arduino to the computer, compile the code using the "make" function on the terminal, and then upload the code using "make upload". Use "serial-mon" to see additional information printed to the serial monitor.

Assumptions:
It is assumed that the user will wait for the screen to finish drawing before moving the joystick (this is important because if the joystick is moved too early, the calibration will not be correct).
It is also assumed that the user will put the LCD screen and Joystick in the correct orientation.
It is assumed that one Arduino has pin 13 connected to ground and one Arduino has pin 13 connected to 5V for multiplayer mode.



Additional Functionality:

Multiplayer/PVP Mode
To enter the multiplayer (PVP) mode, press the joystick when you are in map mode.
Then select either yes (enter PVP mode) or no (return to map mode).

User-Added Content
The user may add his or her own pixelmon if they have the correct file format (convert images to bmp for Arduino at http://javl.github.io/image2cpp/) and by creating his or her own values for name, attacks, and damage in the pixelmondata.cpp file (be sure to change the variable NUM_PIXELMON_TYPES in the pixelmondata.h header file as well).
